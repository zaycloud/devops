# DevOps Automation with GitHub Copilot

## üìå Project Goal

This project demonstrates how to use **GitHub Copilot** to automate key parts of a modern DevOps workflow:

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Automate the provisioning of cloud resources (e.g., using Terraform or Bicep).
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Use GitHub Actions to build, test, and deploy code automatically.
- **Monitoring & Reliability**: Integrate Azure Monitor and Application Insights to track performance and health of deployed apps.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- GitHub Copilot
- Azure Cloud (Web Apps, Monitor, etc.)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- Bash / PowerShell scripts
- YAML workflows

## üöÄ Outcome

By the end of this project, the goal is to:
- Automatically deploy code to Azure on every push
- Monitor resource performance
- Learn to work like a real-world DevOps engineer using automation

## ‚úÖ Status

This project is currently in development and is part of my learning journey in DevOps.
